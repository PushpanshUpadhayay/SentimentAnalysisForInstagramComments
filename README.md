# SentimentAnalysisForInstagramComments

I have used Naive Bayesian Classifier to classify the comments into negative or positive comments. To fetch instagram comments I have used API call. The code is simple and as a beginner I need to work on upgrading my knowledge about NLP so as to upgrade this project using Feature-based methods.

Upgradation:
1) Can use better models such as BERT model or HuggingFace Transformers used in Pytorch to make the classifier more efficient and thus increasing the range of sentiment scores.
